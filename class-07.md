## Domain Modeling

#### Notes

1. The new keyword instantiates (i.e. creates) an object.
2.The constructor function initializes properties inside that object using the this variable
3. The object is stored in a variable for later use.

-Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model for a specific problem. And a domain model that's articulated well can verify and validate your understanding of that problem.

-When modeling a single entity that'll have many instances, build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors

-Model its attributes with a constructor function that defines and initializes properties.

-Model its behaviors with small methods that focus on doing one job well.

-Create instances using the new keyword followed by a call to a constructor function.

-Store the newly created object in a variable so you can access its properties and methods from outside.

-Use the this variable within methods so you can access the object's properties and methods from inside

#### Vocab

- OBJECT-ORIENTED MODEL=  an entity that stores data in properties and encapsulates behaviors in methods


# Chapter 6: “Tables” (pp.126-145)

#### Notes

-table represents info in a grid
-row is created by the tr attribute
-colspan attribute can be used on a tr or td element
-colspan is how many columns a cell should run across
-rowspan the same as colspan
-rowspan is how many rows should span down a table
-long tables can split into thead, tbody and tfoot


#### Vocab
- TABLE CELL= each block in the grid

# Chapter 3: “Functions, Methods, and Objects” (pp.106-144)

#### Notes

-to update the value of propteries, can use dot notation or square brackets.

-use delete keyword to delate a property

-instances of the object using the constructor function

-new keyword followed by a call to the function creates a new function

-data is represented using name/value pairs, in javascript

-arrays hold a related set of key/value pairs, but the key for each value is its index number

-can combine arrays and objects ,to create complex data structueres
1. arrays can have objects inside
2. objects can hold arrays

-availiable tools
1. browser object model
2. document object model
3. global javascript objects

#### Vocab

- GLOBAL CONTEXT= a function created at the top level script it is inside

- OBJECT MODEL= a group of objects
