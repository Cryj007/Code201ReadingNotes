Domain Modeling

Notes

1. The new keyword instantiates (i.e. creates) an object.
2.The constructor function initializes properties inside that object using the this variable
3. The object is stored in a variable for later use.

-Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model for a specific problem. And a domain model that's articulated well can verify and validate your understanding of that problem.

-When modeling a single entity that'll have many instances, build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors

-Model its attributes with a constructor function that defines and initializes properties.

-Model its behaviors with small methods that focus on doing one job well.

-Create instances using the new keyword followed by a call to a constructor function.

-Store the newly created object in a variable so you can access its properties and methods from outside.

-Use the this variable within methods so you can access the object's properties and methods from inside
