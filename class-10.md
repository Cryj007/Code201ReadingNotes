# Chapter 10

#### Notes
-Execution Context
Global Context
-Code in the script not In a function
Function Context
-Code being run within a function
Evaluate Context 
-Text is executed in an internal function
(Not shown in the book, but thought it is a good idea to keep in notes)
-Variable Scope
Global Scope
Declared outside a function, so it can be used anywhere
Function-Level Scope
Declared in a function, can only be used in that function
-Javascript takes data from a function from before to use it in a later function(on a JS interpreter)
-Execution context
Prepare
-New scope is created
-Variables, functions, and arguments are created
Execute
-Can assign values to variables
-Reference functions and run the code
-Execute statements
-Hoisting
calls functions before they have been declared
Assign a value to a variable that has not yet been declared
-Four Types of Errors
SyntaxErrors
ReferenceErrors
Type errors
Range Errors
-Dealing with Errors 
Debug the script to fix errors
Handle errors gracefully
-Console will always show you when there is an error

#### Vocab
- STEPPING OVER= if debugger comes across a function it will step over, or move onto the next line, after the function
