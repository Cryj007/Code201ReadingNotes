# About This Page

This page will have the index for the next 15 pages of notes for Code201 Introductory HTML and JavaScrpit. These notes will contain examples of codes, some voabulary, a couple of analogys, and basic note outlines.

Right now there is not much, but as the lessons go by the more polished this page will become.
