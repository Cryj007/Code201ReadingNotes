#### Notes

-By creating a familiar problem domain, he found that both the tasks of him teaching a new technology and the viewer learning that technology were much easier, because it is very difficult to learn more than one thing at once.

-By taking away the problem domain, or making it so trivial that it is easily understood, he is able to make both teaching and learning easier.

-Figure out what the major components of the picture are

-Sort the pieces by color or component

-Put together all the border pieces

-Put together each component of the picture from the piles you created

-Easily able to learn problem domain and because of it, I might be able to write the code very easily as well

-The more and more he wrote code, the more he learned that understanding the problem is the most critical piece to the equation.

-Make the problem domain easier

-Get better at understanding the problem domain

-You can often make the problem domain easier by cutting out cases and narrowing your focus to a particular part of the problem.

-It is easy to fall into the trap of thinking you understand enough of the problem to get started coding it.

# Chapter 3: “Object Literals” (pp.100-105)

#### Notes
-accessing and updatingth DOM tree
1. locate the node that represents the elemt you want to work with
2. use its text context, child elemts and attributes

1.ACCESS THE ELEMENTS
-select an individual elemt node
-select multiple elements(nodelists)
-traversing between element nodes

2. WORK WITH THOSE ELEMENTS
-access/update text nodes
-work with HTML content
-access or update attribute values

- two ways to select an element from a Nodelist
1. The item() method and array syntax
2. both require the index number of the element

- innerHTML Property
1. approach
2. adding content
3. removing content

- DOM manipulation methods
1. approach
2. adding content
3. removing conent

- DOM manipulation ADDING
1. createElement()
2. createTextNode()
3. appendChild()

- DOM manipulation REMOVING
1. store the element to be removed in a variable
2. store the parent of that element in a variable
3. remove the element from its containing element


#### Vocab
- DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL= specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML page

- DOM TREE= model of the web page

- DOM QUERIES= methods that find elements in the DOM tree

- UNTRUSTED DATA= data not being completely controled over
